      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, most levels and gameplay features are fully available offline. You can enjoy the core game without a
          data or Wi-Fi connection, making it perfect for commutes, travel, or casual offline sessions. However, certain
          features like global leaderboards, daily events, and cloud save will require an internet connection. If you
          reconnect later, your progress will sync automatically. Offline play won’t restrict your core experience, but
          we recommend connecting occasionally for updates and seasonal content.</p>

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, Container Adventure is completely free to download and play. All core gameplay features, levels, and
          boosters can be accessed without spending money. There are optional in-app purchases available, such as extra
          coins or premium boosters, but they are never required to progress. We’ve carefully designed the game so that
          free-to-play users can enjoy the full experience without hitting frustrating paywalls. Whether you spend or
          not, you’ll have access to hundreds of fun and challenging levels. Your skills—not your wallet—define your
          success.</p>

        <img class="faq-arrow" src="/img/arrow-down.svg" alt="Arrow Down">
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>We use a light ad system that respects your time. Short ads may appear after completing levels or when
          claiming free boosters, but they’re never forced during active gameplay. You also have the option to watch ads
          voluntarily in exchange for in-game rewards, such as extra coins or extra moves. We do not show banner ads
          during play. A one-time ad removal purchase is also available if you prefer a completely ad-free experience.

        <button class="faq-question">4. What is the goal of the game?</button>
        <img class="faq-arrow" src="/img/arrow-down.svg" alt="Arrow Down">
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The objective in Container Adventure is to match three or more identical products on a shelf and eliminate
          them. Each level presents different goals—clearing specific items, reaching a score threshold, or removing
          obstacles. As you progress, the puzzles become more complex, requiring thoughtful moves and occasional use of
          boosters. There’s also a sense of progression through unlocking new supermarket areas. The end goal? Becoming
          a master of shelf organization with the highest scores and best strategies.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">5. How do boosters work and when should I use them?</button>
        <img class="faq-arrow" src="/img/arrow-down.svg" alt="Arrow Down">
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Boosters are special tools designed to help you overcome difficult levels. Some clear rows or columns, others
          shuffle the board or target specific items. You can earn them by completing levels or purchase them using
          in-game currency. Timing is important—save boosters for when you're low on moves or stuck with limited
          matching options. Used correctly, a single booster can completely change the course of a level. Remember,
          strategic use is better than random tapping.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">6. How often is new content added?</button>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>We update the game regularly, introducing new levels, themed supermarket areas, and limited-time events.
          Minor bug fixes and balance tweaks are typically released every few weeks, while major content updates happen
          monthly. These updates often include new props, booster rebalancing, and improvements based on player
          feedback. Our development team actively monitors community responses to ensure the game continues to evolve in
          the right direction. You can expect a fresh experience every time you return.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">7. Does the game have a storyline?</button>

      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>While Container Adventure is primarily focused on satisfying match gameplay, we’ve also included light
          narrative elements. As you progress, you'll unlock different supermarket zones, each with its own visual theme
          and design progression. These zones reflect a journey through a quirky, evolving marketworld. Characters may
          appear in event modes in future updates, offering small stories or challenges. For now, the charm lies in the
          visual storytelling of the environment and your personal progression through the shelves.</p>

        <img class="faq-arrow" src="/img/arrow-down.svg" alt="Arrow Down">
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, the game is designed to be safe and enjoyable for all ages. It contains no violence, no inappropriate
          themes, and uses simple touch-based controls that are intuitive even for younger players. Parents can feel
          confident letting children play the game unsupervised. There are no chat features, and all in-app purchases
          are protected by platform payment confirmations. We do recommend supervision if kids have access to in-app
          purchases.</p>

        <button class="faq-question">9. What makes Container Adventure different from other match games?</button>
        <img class="faq-arrow" src="/img/arrow-down.svg" alt="Arrow Down">
      </div>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>While many puzzle games follow a similar matching format, Container Adventure introduces a layered
          supermarket aesthetic that feels fresh and intuitive. The visual satisfaction of sorting through shelves
          combined with fluid animations and an easy-to-learn interface sets it apart. Our level design emphasizes
          strategic depth and minimal frustration. We also offer an experience without pushy monetization or forced wait
          timers. Most importantly, it’s built to be played at your pace—with smooth performance and delightful visuals.

      <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes, progress can be saved and synced across devices using your Google Play account or another connected
          platform. Once linked, your data is stored securely and allows you to continue from where you left off—whether
          on a new phone or tablet. We strongly recommend connecting your game to avoid losing progress if you uninstall
          or change devices. This feature also enables leaderboard access and cloud save options.</p>
